# AI-400: Cloud-Native AI

Learning  FastAPI, Dapr, Docker & Kubernetes with AI-Driven Development (AIDD)

Building cloud-native infrastructure for intelligent agent systems. Using AI-Driven Development (AIDD), learning Fastapi, Docker, Kubernetes, and Dapr to design and deploy production-ready AI agents with observability, scalability, and cloud-agnostic flexibility — laying the foundation for autonomous AI at scale.

## Course Overview

**Duration:** 3 months  
**Prerequisites:** AI-300: AI-Driven Development with Python and Agentic AI

## What You'll Learn

This course transforms developers into cloud thinkers who design systems that make AI work in the real world. You'll learn to build cloud infrastructure for AI agents using Specification-Driven Development and AI-Driven Development (AIDD).

Starting with FastAPI and Docker, you'll package applications into portable containers, then progress to Kubernetes for managing containers at scale. Finally, you'll explore Dapr for cloud-agnostic systems with built-in state management, pub/sub messaging, and service communication.

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Foundations - Cloud Native Infrastructure for AI
Master Context Engineering to structure AI collaboration for infrastructure design. Partner with Claude Code to understand containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and cloud-agnostic abstractions (Dapr). Learn Spec-Driven Development (SDD) fundamentals and establish professional thinking patterns for production deployment.

### Module 2: Docker Fundamentals - Containerizing AI Applications
Containerize FastAPI services using Docker with AIDD and SDD. Specify requirements for multi-stage builds, Python dependencies, and layer optimization while Claude Code generates production Dockerfiles. Master container networking, health checks, and Docker Compose for local development.

### Module 3: Kubernetes Basics - Orchestrating Agent Systems
Orchestrate agent systems on Kubernetes with AIDD and SDD using kubectl-ai and kagent. Specify deployment requirements for pods, services, ConfigMaps, and StatefulSets while Claude Code generates manifests. Master Kubernetes primitives, event-driven patterns with Kafka, and production-grade configurations.

### Module 4: DAPR Core - Cloud-Agnostic Abstractions
Implement Dapr Core and Dapr Workflows for cloud-agnostic communication and long-running processes. Specify requirements for state stores, pub/sub, service invocation, and durable workflows while Claude Code generates Dapr components. Write once, deploy anywhere.

### Module 5: Production Operations - Observability, Scaling & CI/CD
Build production-ready AI systems using SDD for operations and monitoring. Specify observability requirements for OpenTelemetry traces, metrics, and cost dashboards while Claude Code generates telemetry configurations. Master autoscaling, CI/CD with Testcontainers and GitHub Actions, and Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Apply Context Engineering to structure effective AI collaboration for infrastructure design
- Partner with Claude Code to generate production-ready cloud configurations from specifications
- Master Spec-Driven Development (SDD) to design infrastructure through clear intent, not manual YAML
- Containerize AI applications with Docker using AIDD and SDD for multi-stage builds and optimization
- Orchestrate agent systems on Kubernetes with AIDD and SDD using kubectl-ai and kagent
- Implement Dapr Core and Dapr Workflows for cloud-agnostic state, pub/sub, and long-running processes
- Build observable, scalable AI systems with OpenTelemetry, autoscaling, and automated CI/CD pipelines

## Technologies Covered

- **Docker** - Container platform for packaging applications
- **Kubernetes** - Container orchestration for running at scale
- **Dapr** - Cloud-agnostic runtime for distributed systems
- **FastAPI** - Modern Python web framework
- **OpenTelemetry** - Observability framework
- **Kafka** - Event streaming platform
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as Code
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD automation
- **Claude Code** - AI pair programming assistant

## Development Approach

This course emphasizes **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)** and **AI-Driven Development (AIDD)**:

1. You write clear specifications
2. AI generates infrastructure code
3. You validate and deploy

Focus on design and validation rather than memorizing syntax and configuration details.

## Prerequisites

**Required:** AI-300: AI-Driven Development with Python and Agentic AI

These prerequisites provide essential knowledge for success in this course. If you haven't completed AI-300, consider taking it first or reviewing the relevant materials.

## From Local to Production

Learn to take AI projects from local experiments to production-grade systems that:

- Scale automatically
- Recover gracefully
- Run anywhere (cloud-agnostic)
- Include built-in observability
- Deploy with confidence

## Course Philosophy

This course turns developers into cloud thinkers—people who don't just code AI, but design the systems that make AI work in the real world. You'll containerize real AI apps, deploy agent systems on Kubernetes, and use Dapr to connect everything together without locking yourself to a single cloud provider.
